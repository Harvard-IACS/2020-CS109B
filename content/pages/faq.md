# General

- **Do I have access to the video recorded materials if I am not an Extension School student?**
  - Yes. All CS109B students have access to all recorded videos (lectures, labs, & advanced sections) as well as streaming video for labs. Extension School students also have access to live-streaming of lectures due to the nature of some members of the student body of that school. If you have any issues accessing the video content, please send an email to our helpline with your name and HUID.
- **Can I access live streaming?**
  - Only Harvard Extension School students have access to live-streaming of CS109B lectures, and advanced sections.
- **Can I make-up quizzes?**
  - No.  Only 50% of quiz grades will count towards your final grade.  This policy is to reduce stress and is in place so that missing a quiz on occasion should not affect your final grade.

# Auditors

- **Can I audit this course? What can I and cannot do?**
  - Yes, you are welcome to audit this course and attend lecture, sections and lab. However, auditors should not submit HWs or participate in projects, and should refrain from using any course TF resources that are destined and created for our registered students like Ed or JupyterHub.

# Extension School

- **I am an Extension School Student, can I take the quizzes? And do they count towards my grade?**
  - All CS109B students have access to quizzes. If you are a Harvard Extension School student, the quizzes will not be considered towards your final grade. The official quiz will be closed 30 minutes after lecture. After this a duplicate marked "[Extension Students Only]" will be launched. This is to allow students in different time zones to attempt the quiz if they choose. *Note:* only the original quiz will count towards the grade of non-extension students.
- **I am an Extension School student, can I attend lectures and OH in person?**
  - Yes, as a student from a Harvard School you are welcome to attend all learning instances (lecture, OH, advanced sections, and labs) in person. Given the distance nature of the student body of Harvard Extension School, we also provide live streaming and video capture of our learning instances.
