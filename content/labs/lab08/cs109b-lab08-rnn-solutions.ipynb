    "In this task, we are going to do sentiment classification on a movie review dataset. We are going to build a feedforward net, a convolutional neural net, a recurrent net and combine one or more of them to understand performance of each of them. A sentence can be thought of as a sequence of words that collectively represent meaning. Individual words impact the meaning. Thus, the context matters; words that occur earlier in the sentence influence the sentence's structure and meaning in the latter part of the sentence (e.g., Jose asked Anqi if she were going to the library today). Likewise, words that occur later in a sentence can affect the meaning of earlier words (e.g., Apple is an interesting company). As we have seen in lecture, if we wish to make use of a full sentence's context in both directions, then we should use a bi-directional RNN (e.g., Bi-LSTM). For the purpose of this tutorial, we are going to restrict ourselves to only uni-directional RNNs."

    "Computers have no built-in knowledge of words or their meanings and cannot understand them in any rich way that humans do -- hence, the purpose of Natural Language Processing (NLP). As with any data science, computer science, machine learning task, the first crucial step is to clean (pre-process) your data so that you can soundly make use of it. Within NLP, this first step is called Tokenization and it concerns how to represent each token (a.k.a. word) of your corpus (i.e., dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TOKENIZATION\n",
    "\n",
    "A ``token`` refers to a single, atomic unit of meaning (i.e., a word). How should our computers represent each word? We could read in our corpus word by word and store each word as a String (data structure). However, Strings tend to use more computer memory than Integers and can become cumbersome. As long as we preserve the uniqueness of the tokens and are consistent, we are better off converting each distinct word to a distinct number (Integer). This is standard practice within NLP / computer science / data science, etc.\n",
    "As a simple example of tokenization, we can see a small example.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the five sentences below were our entire corpus, our conversion would look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. i have books - [1, 4, 7]\n",
    "2. interesting books are useful [10,2,9,8]\n",
    "3. i have computers [1,4,6]\n",
    "4. computers are interesting and useful [6,9,11,10,8]\n",
    "5. books and computers are both valuable. [2,10,2,9,13,12]\n",
    "6. Bye Bye [7,7]\n",
    "\n",
    "Create tokens for vocabulary based on frequency of occurrence. Hence, we assign the following tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "I-1, books-2, computers-3, have-4, are-5, computers-6,bye-7, useful-8, are-9, and-10,interesting-11, valuable-12, both-13\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, our dataset is already represented in such a tokenized form.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Often times, depending on your NLP task, it is useful to also perform other pre-processing, cleaning steps, such as:\n",
    "- treating each punctuation mark as a token (e.g., , . ! ? are each separate tokens)\n",
    "- lower-casing all words (so that a given word isn't treated differently just because it starts a sentence or not)\n",
    "- separating each sentence with a unique symbol (e.g., <S> and </S>)\n",
    "- removing words that are incredibly common (e.g., function words, (in)definite articles). These are referred to as 'stopwords'). For language modelling, we DO NOT remove stopwords. A sentence's meaning needs to include all of the original words."

    "#### What is an embedding layer ? \n",
    "\n",
    "An embedding is a \"distributed representation\" (e.g., vector) of a particular atomic item (e.g., word token, object, etc). When representing items by embeddings:\n",
    "- each distinct item should be represented by its own unique embedding\n",
    "- the semantic similarity between items should correspond to the similarity between their respective embeddings (i.e., words that are more similar to one another should have embeddings that are more similar to each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are essentially an infinite number of ways to create such embeddings, and since these representations have such a great influence on the performance of our models, there has been an incredible amount of research dedicated to this very aspect. If you are interested in learning more, start with the astromonically impactful papers of [word2vec](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf) and [GloVe](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1162.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, though, one can view the embedding process as a linear projection from one vector space to another (e.g., a vector space of unique words being mapped to a world of fixed-length, dense vectors filled with continuous-valued numbers. For NLP, we usually use embeddings to project the one-hot encodings of words (i.e., a vector that is the length of the entire vocabulary, and it is filled with all zeros except for a single value of 1 that corresponds to the particular word) on to a lower-dimensional continuous space (e.g., vectors of size 100) so that the input surface is dense and possibly smooth. Thus, one can view this embedding layer process as just a transformation from $\\mathbb{R}^{inp}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^{emb}$"

They give a solid performance, low memory footprint (thanks to shared parameters) and are able to understand and leverage the temporally connected information contained in the inputs. There is still an open debate about the performance vs memory benefits of CNNs vs RNNs in the research community.\n",

    "As a side-note and bit of history: how amazing is it that we can construct these neural networks, train them, and evaluate them in just a few lines of code?! Imagine if we didn't have deep learning libraries like Keras and Tensorflow; we'd have to write backpropagation and gradient descent by hand. Our last network could easily require thousands of lines of code and many hours of debugging. This is what many people did just 8 years ago, since deep learning wasn't common and the community hadn't yet written nicely packaged libraries. Many libraries have come and gone, but nowadays most people use either Tensorflow/Keras (by Google) or PyTorch (by Facebook). I expect them to remain as great libraries for the foreseeable future, so if you're interested in deep learning, it's worth the investment to learn one, or both, of them well."

    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we are going to teach addition to our model. Given two numbers (<999), the model outputs their sum (<9999). The input is provided as a string '231+432' and the model will provide its output as ' 663' (Here the empty space is the padding character). We are not going to use any external dataset and are going to construct our own dataset for this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise we attempt to do effectively \"translates\" a sequence of characters '231+432' to another sequence of characters ' 663' and hence, this class of models are called sequence-to-sequence models (aka seq2seq). Such architectures have profound applications in several real-life tasks such as machine translation, summarization, image captioning etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, sequence-to-sequence (aka seq2seq) models take as input a sequence of length N and return a sequence of length M, where N and M may or may not differ, and every single observation/input may be of different values, too. For example, machine translation concerns converting text from one natural language to another (e.g., translating English to French). Google Translate is an example, and their system is a seq2seq model. The input (e.g., an English sentence) can be of any length, and the output (e.g., a French sentence) may be of any length.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background knowledge:** The earliest and most simple seq2seq model works by having one RNN for the input, just like we've always done, and we refer to it as being an \"encoder.\" The final hidden state of the encoder RNN is fed as input to another RNN that we refer to as the \"decoder.\" The job of the decoder is to generate each token, one word at a time. This may seem really limiting, as it relies on the encoder encapsulating the entire input sequence with just 1 hidden layer. It seems unrealistic that we could encode an entire meaning of a sentence with just one hidden layer. Yet, results even in this simplistic manner can be quite impressive. In fact, these early results were compelling enough that these models immediately replaced the decades of earlier machine translation work."
