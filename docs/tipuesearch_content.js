Yes. All CS109B students have access to all recorded videos (lectures, labs, & advanced sections) as well as streaming video for labs. Extension School students also have access to live-streaming of lectures due to the nature of some members of the student body of that school. If you have any issues accessing the video content, please send an email to our helpline with your name and HUID. Can I access live streaming? Only Harvard Extension School students have access to live-streaming of CS109B lectures, and advanced sections. Can I make-up quizzes? No. Only 50% of quiz grades will count towards your final grade. This policy is to reduce stress and is in place so that missing a quiz on occasion should not affect your final grade. Auditors Can I audit this course? What can I and cannot do? Yes, you are welcome to audit this course and attend lecture, sections and lab. However, auditors should not submit HWs or participate in projects, and should refrain from using any course TF resources that are destined and created for our registered students like Ed or JupyterHub. Extension School I am an Extension School Student, can I take the quizzes? And do they count towards my grade? All CS109B students have access to quizzes. If you are a Harvard Extension School student, the quizzes will not be considered towards your final grade. The official quiz will be closed 30 minutes after lecture. After this a duplicate marked \"[Extension Students Only]\" will be launched. This is to allow students in different time zones to attempt the quiz if they choose. Note: only the original quiz will count towards the grade of non-extension students. I am an Extension School student, can I attend lectures and OH in person? Yes, as a student from a Harvard School you are welcome to attend all learning instances (lecture, OH, advanced sections, and labs) in person. Given the distance nature of the student body of Harvard Extension School, we also provide live streaming and video capture of our learning instances.","tags":"pages","url":"pages/faq.html"},{"title":"Homework Policies & Submission Instructions","text":"pre { background-color: #F5F5F5; display: block; font-family: monospace; font-size: 14px; white-space: pre; border-color: #999999; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-radius: 6px; margin: 1em 0; padding: 5px; white-space: pre-wrap; } .containerMain { display: flex; width: 100%; height: 300px; } V. Jan 29, 2020 General Policies Colaboration Except for HW2 and HW6 which will be done by each student individually , you're allowed and encouraged to work with a fellow student on the homework. This does not mean that you are to divide and conquer. In the spirit of learning and getting the most out of this course and out of collaborating with your peer, you should solve each problem on your own, compare with your partner, and decide on a common solution. Importing Libraries As much as possible, try and stick to the hints and functions we import at the top of the homework, as those are the ideas and tools the class supports and is aiming to teach. And if a problem specifies a particular library you're required to use that library, and possibly others from the import list. You are allowed to use other libraries such as seaborn. Submitting HW Late Submissions will not be accepted. Extensions are provided only for medical reasons with a doctor's note. If there are issues, send an email to the course email: cs109b2020@gmail.com . Homework assignments will be done in Python in the Jupyter Notebook environment. When you are finished editing your notebook, re-run all the cells to make sure they work . Normally, you need only submit the .ipynb file with one caveat: If your notebook references other files such as images which are necessary for interpreting your work, they must be uploaded as well. You may also choose to \"attach\" the images to the notebook itself. See the section on markdown attachments under \"other additions\" here for details. Please do not submit .zip or .rar files. File Naming Convention Do not include your name in the paper or the filename as we try to keep grading as anonymous as possible. Making a HW Group in Canvas DO NOT join a group if you are submitting the assignment alone. DO NOT make new groups. Look for an empty group among the pre-made groups for each assignment and join it. Follow instructions below. Click \"People\" in the navbar Click the \"Groups\" tab Type in the search box: \"HW#\" (replace # with the homework number, e.g. HW3) Choose an empty group and have both members in your pair click \"Join\". Again, this must be done before you submit and before the homework deadline. If you haven't joined a group before the homework deadline, we will assume you are working alone. Groups do not persist across assignments. You need to make a group for every assignment. Warning: If you are submitting in a pair: both members must join a Canvas group BEFORE they submit and BEFORE the homework deadline, whichever is earlier. If your group is not in place when you submit or if you submit after the assignment deadline, then you are submitting alone. This is a Canvas limitation.

Given the strong evidence that the presence of fine particulate matter in the atmosphere increases mortality and hospitalization rates, it is important that we can track and predict these pollution levels. One of the main challenges in this work is that the fine particulate matter detectors are sparsely located across the US, meaning that many areas do not have quality data. In this project, you will build a model to predict fine particulate matter pollution in the untracked regions of the US, given data from the tracked areas. This data includes meteorological readings, land use data, and satellite data. Francesca Dominici is the Clarence James Gamble Professor of Biostatistics, Population and Data Science at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Director of the Data Science Initiative at Harvard University. Dr. Dominici is an international leader at the interface of statistics, data science, causal inference and and public health. Dr. Dominici has stellar leadership in education and mentoring, and the promotion of diversity and gender equality. Dr. Dominici's team has provided the scientific community and policy makers with robust evidence on the adverse health effects of air pollution, and climate change. Her studies have directly and routinely impacted air quality policy, leading to more stringent ambient air quality standards in the US. Room Labelling and Object Arrangement Floor plans play an invaluable role in the architectural world - they tell us the shape and size of a built environment , and also convey the architect ' s vision for the style and feel of the final product. Much of this work is currently done with 3D renderings, but in the past, a 2D floor plan was the standard. Many of these floor plans exist as essentially unstructured data, such as images. In this project, you will be working with a data set of approximately 1000 floor plans. While it is easy for a human to look at one of these images and understand the purpose of each room, a computer has a harder time understanding this. Your goal is to build a system to identify the different types of rooms (living room, bed room, etc.) in each floor plan, and extract relevant metadata from their properties. Such metadata could be recognizing furniture symbols with size and location, and/or drawing hard boundaries between rooms. A wonderful stretch-goal could be for the system to automatically populate rooms with furniture appropriate to its use. Jose Luis García del Castillo y López is an architect, computational designer, and educator. He advocates for a future where programming and code are tools as natural to artists as paper and pencil. In his work, he explores creative opportunities at the intersection of design, technology, fabrication, data and art. He is currently a Lecturer in Architectural Technology at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. Data Science for Case Law This project will challenge you to read case law, and generate automatic summarizations of the cases. Headnotes are brief case summary statements often generated by commercial third parties. They are under copyright protection, and so are not always available or are subject to many usage restrictions. In this project, you will reconstruct these headnotes for a variety of cases, using historical court cases as a training set. We will use the Caselaw Access Project, a recently-released dataset of all United States case law from the Harvard Law School Library. Jack Cushman is a Lecturer at the Harvard Law School. Jack teaches Computer Programming for Lawyers at Harvard Law School and is a senior developer at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab. He previously practiced as an appellate lawyer at the firm of Stern, Shapiro, Weissberg and Garin. Kelly Fitzpatrick is a Research Associate at the Harvard Law School Library. Kelly runs outreach and communications for the Caselaw Access Project at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab. She holds a masters in library science and worked previously on the Harvard Open Access Project. Predicting Disease Activity This project involves applying machine learning techniques and novel Internet-based data sources for real-time monitoring and short-term forecasting of population-level disease activity. In this project, you will learn how to design and deploy predictive models to track and forecast epidemic outbreaks in real time. For this, you will gain access to epidemiological data of ongoing and historical disease outbreaks in the US and other countries. Diseases of interest include Influenza (USA), Dengue fever (Puerto Rico and Peru), Ebola (DRC), Coronavirus 2019-nCoV (China and the world). Given that most epidemiological monitoring systems in the world provide lagged information about disease activity (case counts of infected people are known to decision-makers weeks after the fact due to lab testing and data collection delays), you will learn how to design and implement time-series based prediction models to estimate the likely disease activity in current time and future weeks. You will learn how to utilize data sources that were not originally designed to be indicators of disease activity to complement time-series predictive models. These data sources include: disease-related Google search activity, disease-related Twitter microblogs, air travel, and weather patterns.

Predicting Project Success Data Science has become a core function in many firms today, driving innovation and new data-intensive business and operating models. This project will demonstrate how data and data science offers unprecedented opportunities to organizations in running their business, focusing on project planning capabilities. In this project, you will be exposed to concepts related to business operations and an in depth understanding of the role of data and predictions in these operations. In particular, can project success or failure (defined by budgetary or temporal constraints) be predicted ahead of time, given a variety of project features? Many businesses operate without a reliable predictor of project success, and therefore waste time and money due to mismanagement. This project addresses a real-world business need with data, and will help managers better plan their business operations.

Education: B.Sc., Ben-Gurion University; MSc, London School of Economics; Ph.D., MRes, London Business School Measuring the shape and brightness of galaxies with neural networks For decades, astronomers have scanned the sky with increasingly powerful telescopes and cameras, collecting millions of digital images of billions of stars, galaxies, and other objects. These \"sky surveys\" collect so much data that no human could ever look at it all directly, so we rely on automated software to detect objects, isolate them from their neighbors, and determine their properties. Traditionally this has been done by model fitting. For example, to characterize a galaxy, we use a parametric generative model for the galaxy that outputs an image (values in a grid of pixels) as a function of the location, size, shape, orientation, and brightness of the galaxy. A common choice is the Sérsic profile (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sersic_profile). One can define an objective function (or loss function) given the model and a noise model, and run an optimizer or Markov chain Monte Carlo to estimate the parameters and their uncertainty. Much of modern astronomy is built on this approach, even though the Sérsic model is not a terribly good fit for many galaxies. A more modern approach would be to use neural networks. This would allow us to specify our concept of what galaxies look like by using many training examples (real or simulated) rather than a functional form. The neural network can be trained with those input examples, and desired output parameters, and then applied to new data. For this module we will use the galsim software (https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim) to generate mock data with known parameters and noise. We will then train a neural net on the mock data, and quantify its performance. By showing that modern data-driven approaches can succeed on this problem, we open the door to future work on real galaxies, including edge cases such as merging systems of galaxies, or galaxies that overlap along the line of sight -- situations that traditional methods sometimes handle poorly. Dr. Douglas Finkbeiner has a joint appointment in the Department of Astronomy and Department of Physics, working on topics ranging from dark matter to interstellar dust. He is currently excited about the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), a 5000-fiber spectrograph on the 4m telescope at Kitt Peak, AZ.","tags":"pages","url":"pages/modules.html"},{"title":"Resources","text":"pre { background-color: #F5F5F5; display: block; font-family: monospace; font-size: 14px; white-space: pre; border-color: #999999; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-radius: 6px; margin: 1em 0; padding: 5px; white-space: pre-wrap; } .containerMain { display: flex; width: 100%; height: 300px; } FAQ GitHub Repo Ed Guides Homework Policies & Submission Instructions JupyterHub (requires Canvas access)","tags":"pages","url":"pages/resources.html"},{"title":"Schedule","text":"Week Lecture (Mon) Lecture (Weds) Lab (Mon) Advanced Section (Weds) Assignment (R:Released Weds - D:Due Thurs) 1 Lecture 1: Introduction + Smoothers and Additive 1/3 Lecture 2: Smoothers and Additive 2/3 Lab 1: Getting Started HW1 - R: 1/29 D: 2/6 2 Lecture 3: Smoothers and GAM 3/3 Lecture 4: Unsupervised learning/clustering 1 Lab 2: Smoothers+GAM HW2 - R: 2/5 D: 2/20 3 Lecture 5: Unsupervised learning/clustering 2 Lecture 6: Bayesian 1/3 Lab 3: Clustering No New Assignment 4 No Lecture (Presidents' Day) Lecture 7: Bayesian 2/3 No Lab (President's Day) HW3 - R: 2/19 D: 3/5 5 Lecture 8: Bayesian 3/3 Lecture 9: ML/NN Roadmap Lab 4: Bayesian No New Assignment 6 Lecture 10: CNN-1 Lecture 11: CNN-2 Lab 5: CNNs-1 A-Sec 1: ResNet, Dense-Net, res-Next and Inception and transfer learning HW4 - R: 3/4 D: 3/12 7 Lecture 12: Autoencoders + Unet Lecture 13: RNN1 Lab 6: CNNs -2 A-Sec 2: Segmentation Techniques, YOLO, Unet and M-RCNN HW5 - R: 3/11 D: 3/26 8 No Lecture (Spring Break) No Lecture No Lab No A-Sec No New Assignment 9 Lecture 14: RNN2 + Text1 Lecture 15: Text2 Lab 7: AE A-Sec 3: RNN, echo state HW6 - R: 3/25 D: 4/9 10 Lecture 16: Text3 Lecture 17: VAE + Generative models Lab 8: RNNS A-Sec 4: Variational Inference No New Assignment 11 Lecture 18: GANS 1 Lecture 19: GANS 2 Lab 9: Text A-Sec 5: GANS.

Course Components There will be live video feed available only to continuing education students for lectures, labs, and advanced sections. Recordings for all other students will be available within 24 hrs. Video streams and recordings can be accessed from the Videos section on Canvas. Lectures The class meets twice a week for lectures. Attending lectures is a crucial component of learning the material presented in this course. Labs Lectures are supplemented by weekly lab sections that include additional discussion of the course material, hands-on programming exercises, and group activities. In-Class Quizzes At the end of each lecture, we will ask you to take a short, graded quiz on the material presented in class; there will be no AC209b content in the quizzes. 50% of the quizzes will be dropped from your grade. DCE students' quizzes will not count toward their final grade. Advanced Sections The course will include advanced sections for 209b students and will cover a different topic per week. These are 75 min lectures and they will cover advanced topics like the mathematical underpinnings of the methods seen in lecture and lab and extensions of those methods. The material covered in the advanced sections is required for all AC209b students. Tentative topics are: ResNet, Dense-Net, res-Next and Inception and transfer learning Segmentation Techniques, YOLO, Unet and M-RCNN RNN, Echo State Variational Inference GANS. Cycle GANS, etc. RL Exams There are no exams in this course. Projects Non-DCE Students During the final four (4) weeks of the course, students will be divided in break-out thematic sections where they will study topics. These topics are tentative at the moment but may include medicine, law, astronomy, e-commerce, and government. Each section will include lectures by Harvard faculty, experts on the field, followed by project work also led by that faculty. You will get to present your projects in the SEAS Design Fair at the end of the semester. DCE Students The goal of the project is to have a complete end-to-end data science process encompassing both semesters of subject material while working as a 3-4 person team. We will supply a small set of project choices within the thematic categories. Teams may propose a different project with sufficient notice and will be subject to approval by the course staff. Homework Assignments There will be eight graded homework assignments. Some of them will be due one week after being assigned and some will be due two weeks after being assigned. For six assignments, you have the option to work and submit in pairs, the two remaining are to be completed individually. Course Resources Online Materials All course materials, including lecture notes, lab notes, and section notes will be published on the course GitHub repo as well as the public site's Materials section . Note: Lecture content for weeks 1-3 is only available to registered students through the Materals section. Assignments will only be posted on Canvas. Working Environment You will be working in Jupyter Notebooks which you can run in your own machine or in the SEAS JupyterHub cloud (see lab 1 for details). Recommended Textbooks ISLR: An Introduction to Statistical Learning by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (Springer: New York, 2013) DL: Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville. (The MIT Press: Cambridge, 2016) Free electronic versions are available ( ISLR , DL ) or hard copy through Amazon ( ISLR , DL ). Getting Help For questions about homework, course content, package installation, the process is: try to troubleshoot yourself by reading the lecture, lab, and section notes, and looking up online resources. go to office hours this is the best way to get help. post on the class Ed forum; we want you and your peers to engage in helping each other. TFs also monitor Ed and will respond within 24 hours. Note that Ed questions are visible to everyone. If you are citing homework solution code you must post privately so that only the staff sees your message. watch for official announcements via Canvas so make sure you have your Canvas notifications turned on. Ed should always be your first resource for seeking answers to your content questions. send an email to the Helpline cs109b2020@gmail.com for administrative issues, regrade requests, and non-content specific questions. for personal matters that you do not feel comfortable sharing with the TFs, you may send an email to either or both of the instructors. Course Policies and Expectations Grading for CS109b, STAT121b, and CS209b (tentative): Your final score for the course will be computed using the following weights: Non-DCE Students Assignment Final Grade Weight Paired Homework (6) 47% Individual Homework (2) 21% Quizzes 8% Ed Exercises 4% Project 20% Total 100% Note: Regular homework (for everyone) counts as 5 points. 209b extra homework counts as 1 point. DCE Students Assignment Final Grade Weight Paired Homework (6) 51% Individual Homework (2) 23% Ed Exercises 4% Project 22% Total 100% Collaboration Policy We expect you to adhere to the Harvard Honor Code at all times. Failure to adhere to the honor code and our policies may result in serious penalties, up to and including automatic failure in the course and reference to the ad board. If you work with a partner on an assignment make sure both parties solve all the problems. Do not divide and conquer. You are expected to be intellectually honest and give credit where credit is due. In particular: if you work with a fellow student but decide to submit different papers, include the name of each other in the designated area of the submission paper. if you work with a fellow student and want to submit the same paper you need to form a group prior to the submission. Details in the assignment. Not all assignments will permit group submissions. you need to write your solutions entirely on your own or with your collaborator you are welcome to take ideas from code presented in labs, lecture, or sections but you need to change it, adapt it to your style, and ultimately write your own. We do not want to see code copied verbatim from the above sources. if you use code found on the internet, books, or other sources you need to cite those sources. you should not view any written materials or code created by other students for the same assignment; you may not provide or make available solutions to individuals who take or may take this course in the future. if the assignment allows it you may use third-party libraries and example code, so long as the material is available to all students in the class and you give proper attribution. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers. Late or Wrongly Submitted Assignments There are no late days in homework submission. We will accept late submissions only for medical reasons and if accompanied by a doctor's note. To submit after Canvas has closed or to ask for an extension , send an email to the Helpline with subject line \"Submit HW1: Reason=the flu\" replacing 'HW1' with the name of the current assignment and \"the flu\" with your reason. You need to attach the note from your medical provider otherwise we will not accept the request. If you forgot to join a Group with your peer and are asking for the same grade we will accept this with no penalty up to HW3. For homeworks beyond that we feel that you should be familiar with the process of joining groups. After that there will be a penalty of -1 point for both members of the group provided the submission was on time. Re-grade Requests Our graders and instructors make every effort in grading accurately and in giving you a lot of feedback. If you discover that your answer to a homework problem was correct but it was marked as incorrect, send an email to the Helpline with a description of the error. Please do not submit regrade requests based on what you perceive is overly harsh grading . The points we take off are based on a grading rubric that is being applied uniformly to all assignments. If you decide to send a regrade request , send an email to the Helpline with subject line \"Regrade HW1: Grader=johnsmith\" replacing 'HW1' with the current assignment and 'johnsmith' with the name of the grader within 48 hours of the grade release . Auditing the Class If you would like to audit the class, please send an email to the Helpline indicating who you are and why you want to audit the class. You need a HUID to be included to Canvas. Please note that auditors may not submit assignments for grading or make use of other limited student resources such as office hours. Academic Integrity Ethical behavior is an important trait of a Data Scientist, from ethically handling data to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in CS109b we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty. As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together. For more detailed expectations, please refer to the Collaborations section above. Accommodations for students with disabilities Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and speak with the professor by the end of the second week of the term, (fill in specific date). Failure to do so may result in the Course Head's inability to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential, although Faculty are invited to contact AEO to discuss appropriate implementation. Diversity and Inclusion Statement Data Science, like many fields of science, has historically only been represented by a small sliver of the population. This is despite some of the early computer scientist pioneers being women (see Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper for two examples). Recent initiatives have attempted to overcome some barriers to entry: Made w/ Code . We would like to attempt to discuss diversity in data science from time to time where appropriate and possible. Please contact us (in person or electronically) or submit anonymous feedback if you have any suggestions to improve the diversity of the course materials. Furthermore, we would like to create a learning environment for our students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this: If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Harvard records, please let us know! If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns). If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, you may find helpful resources at the Harvard Office of Diversity and Inclusion . We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option.) As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates.","tags":"pages","url":"pages/syllabus.html"},{"title":"Advanced Sections 01:","text":"Slides","tags":"a-section","url":"a-section/a-section01/"},{"title":"Advanced Sections 02:","text":"Slides","tags":"a-section","url":"a-section/a-section02/"},{"title":"Advanced Sections 03:","text":"Slides","tags":"a-section","url":"a-section/a-section03/"},{"title":"Advanced Sections 04:","text":"Slides","tags":"a-section","url":"a-section/a-section04/"},{"title":"Advanced Sections 05:","text":"Slides","tags":"a-section","url":"a-section/a-section05/"},{"title":"Lab 05:","text":"Slides","tags":"labs","url":"labs/lab05/"},{"title":"Lab 06:","text":"Slides","tags":"labs","url":"labs/lab06/"},{"title":"Lab 07:","text":"Slides","tags":"labs","url":"labs/lab07/"},{"title":"Lab 08:","text":"Slides","tags":"labs","url":"labs/lab08/"},{"title":"Lab 09:","text":"Slides","tags":"labs","url":"labs/lab09/"},{"title":"Lab 10:","text":"Slides","tags":"labs","url":"labs/lab10/"},{"title":"Lab 11:","text":"Slides","tags":"labs","url":"labs/lab11/"},{"title":"Lab 12:","text":"Slides","tags":"labs","url":"labs/lab12/"},{"title":"Lecture 11:","text":"Slides","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture11/"},{"title":"Lecture 12:","text":"Slides","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture12/"},{"title":"Lecture 13:","text":"Slides","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture13/"},{"title":"Lecture 14:","text":"Slides","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture14/"},{"title":"Lecture 15:","text":"Slides","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture15/"},{"title":"Lecture 16:","text":"Slides","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture16/"},{"title":"Lecture 17:","text":"Slides","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture17/"},{"title":"Lecture 18:","text":"Slides","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture18/"},{"title":"Lecture 19:","text":"Slides","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture19/"},{"title":"Lecture 20:","text":"Slides","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture20/"},{"title":"Lecture 21:","text":"Slides","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture21/"},{"title":"Lecture 22:","text":"Slides","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture22/"},{"title":"Lecture 23:","text":"Slides","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture23/"},{"title":"Lecture 24:","text":"Slides","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture24/"},{"title":"Lecture 25:","text":"Slides","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture25/"},{"title":"Lecture 26:","text":"Slides","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture26/"},{"title":"Lab 4: Bayesian Analysis (Extended)","text":"/*! * * IPython notebook * */ /* CSS font colors for translated ANSI escape sequences */ /* The color values are a mix of http://www.xcolors.net/dl/baskerville-ivorylight and http://www.xcolors.net/dl/euphrasia */ .ansi-black-fg { color: #3E424D;

Practice how to apply Bayesian analysis using PyMC3 Avoid getting fired when talking to your Bayesian employer. This lab corresponds to Lectures 6, 7, and 8, and maps to Homework 3. Table of Contents The Bayesian Way of Thinking or Is this a Fair Coin? Intro to pyMC3 . Bayesian Linear Regression . 1. The Bayesian way of Thinking Here is my state of knowledge about the situation. Here is some data, I am now going to revise my state of knowledge. Table Exercise : Discuss the statement above with your table mates and make sure everyone understands what it means and what constitutes Bayesian way of thinking. Finally, count the Bayesians among you. A. Bayes Rule \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:bayes} P(A|\\textbf{B}) = \\frac{P(\\textbf{B} |A) P(A) }{P(\\textbf{B})} \\end{equation} $P(A|\\textbf{B})$ is the posterior distribution, prob(hypothesis | data) $P(\\textbf{B} |A)$ is the likelihood function, how probable is my data B for different values of the parameters $P(A)$ is the marginal probability to observe the data, called the prior , this captures our belief about the data before observing it. $P(\\textbf{B})$ is the marginal distribution (sometimes called marginal likelihood) Table Exercise : Solve the Monty Hall Paradox using Bayes Rule. The problem we are about to solve gained fame as part of a game show \"Let's Make A Deal\" hosted by Monty Hall, hence its name. It was first raised by Steve Selvin in American Statistician in 1975. The game is as follows: there are 3 doors behind one of which are the keys to a new car. There is a goat behind each of the other two doors. Let's assume your goal is to get the car and not a goat. You are asked to pick one door, and let's say you pick Door1 . The host knows where the keys are. Of the two remaining closed doors, he will always open the door that has a goat behind it. He'll say \"I will do you a favor and open Door2 \". So he opens Door2 inside which there is, of course, a goat. He now asks you, do you want to open the initial Door you chose or change to Door3 ? Generally, in this game, when you are presented with this choice should you swap the doors? Initial Steps: Start by defining the events of this probabilities game. One definition is: $A_i$: car is behind door $i$ $B_i$ host opens door $i$ $i\\in[1,2,3]$ In more math terms, the question is: is the probability of the price is behind Door 1 higher than the probability of the price is behind Door2 , given that an event has occured ? B. Bayes Rule Revisited We have data that we believe come from an underlying distribution of unknown parameters. If we find those parameters, we know everything about the process that generated this data and we can make inferences (create new data). \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:bayes} P(\\theta|\\textbf{D}) = \\frac{P(\\textbf{D} |\\theta) P(\\theta) }{P(\\textbf{D})} \\end{equation} But what is $\\theta \\;$? $\\theta$ is an unknown yet fixed set of parameters. In Bayesian inference we express our belief about what $\\theta$ might be and instead of trying to guess $\\theta$ exactly, we look for its probability distribution . What that means is that we are looking for the parameters of that distribution. For example, for a Poisson distribution our $\\theta$ is only $\\lambda$. In a normal distribution, our $\\theta$ is often just $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$. C. A review of Common Probability Distributions Discrete Distributions The random variable has a probability mass function (pmf) which measures the probability that our random variable will take a specific value $y$, denoted $P(Y=y)$. Bernoulli (binary outcome, success has probability $\\theta$, $one$ trial): $ P(Y=k) = \\theta&#94;k(1-\\theta)&#94;{1-k} $ Binomial (binary outcome, success has probability $\\theta$, $k$ sucesses, $n$ trials): \\begin{equation} P(Y=k) = {{n}\\choose{k}} \\cdot \\theta&#94;k(1-\\theta)&#94;{n-k} \\end{equation} Note : Binomial(1,$p$) = Bernouli($p$) Negative Binomial Poisson (counts independent events occurring at a rate $\\lambda$) \\begin{equation} P\\left( Y=y|\\lambda \\right) = \\frac{{e&#94;{ - \\lambda } \\lambda &#94;y }}{{y!}} \\end{equation} y = 0,1,2,... Discrete Uniform Categorical, or Multinulli (random variables can take any of K possible categories, each having its own probability; this is a generalization of the Bernoulli distribution for a discrete variable with more than two possible outcomes, such as the roll of a die) Dirichlet-multinomial (a generalization of the beta distribution for many variables) Continuous Distributions The random variable has a probability density function (pdf) . Uniform (variable equally likely to be near each value in interval $(a,b)$) \\begin{equation} P(X = x) = \\frac{1}{b - a} \\end{equation} anywhere within the interval $(a, b)$, and zero elsewhere. Normal (a.k.a. Gaussian) \\begin{equation} X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\,\\sigma&#94;{2}) \\end{equation} A Normal distribution can be parameterized either in terms of precision $\\tau$ or variance $\\sigma&#94;{2}$. The link between the two is given by \\begin{equation} \\tau = \\frac{1}{\\sigma&#94;{2}} \\end{equation} Expected mean $\\mu$ Variance $\\frac{1}{\\tau}$ or $\\sigma&#94;{2}$ Parameters: mu: float , sigma: float or tau: float Beta (where the variable ($\\theta$) takes on values in the interval $[0,1]$, and is parametrized by two positive parameters, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ that control the shape of the distribution. Note that Beta is a good distribution to use for priors (beliefs) because its range is $[0,1]$ which is the natural range for a probability and because we can model a wide range of functions by changing the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ parameters. \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:beta} P(\\theta|a,b) = \\frac{1}{B(\\alpha, \\beta)} {\\theta}&#94;{\\alpha - 1} (1 - \\theta)&#94;{\\beta - 1} \\propto {\\theta}&#94;{\\alpha - 1} (1 - \\theta)&#94;{\\beta - 1} \\end{equation} where the normalisation constant, $B$, is a beta function of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, \\begin{equation} B(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\int_{t=0}&#94;1 t&#94;{\\alpha - 1} (1 - t)&#94;{\\beta - 1} dt. \\end{equation} Exponential Gamma Code Resources: Statistical Distributions in numpy/scipy: scipy.stats Statistical Distributions in pyMC3: distributions in PyMC3 (we will see those below). Exercise: Discrete Probability Distributions Plots Poisson Change the value of $\\lambda$ in the Poisson PMF and see how the plot changes. Remember that the y-axis in a discrete probability distribution shows the probability of the random variable having a specific value in the x-axis. \\begin{equation} P\\left( X=y \\right|\\lambda) = \\frac{{e&#94;{ - \\lambda } \\lambda &#94;y }}{{y!}} \\end{equation} for $y \\ge0$. Routine is stats.poisson.pmf(x, lambda) . $\\lambda$ is our $\\theta$ in this case. $\\lambda$ is also the mean in this distribution.

Remember that the y-axis in a continuous probability distribution does not shows the actual probability of the random variable having a specific value in the x-axis because that probability is zero!. Instead, to see the probability that the variable is within a small margin we look at the integral below the curve of the PDF. The uniform is often used as a noninformative prior. Uniform - numpy.random.uniform(a=0.0, b=1.0, size) $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are our parameters. size is how many tries to perform. Our $\\theta$ is basically the combination of the parameters a,b. We can also call it \\begin{equation} \\mu = (a+b)/2 \\end{equation} In [9]: from scipy.stats import uniform r = uniform . rvs ( size = 1000 ) plt . plot ( r , uniform . pdf ( r ), 'r-' , lw = 5 , alpha = 0.6 , label = 'uniform pdf' ) plt . hist ( r , density = True , histtype = 'stepfilled' , alpha = 0.2 ) plt . ylabel ( r 'probability density' ) plt . xlabel ( f 'random variable' ) plt . legend ( loc = 'best' , frameon = False ) plt . show () Beta If we apply the formula we can see why we get these plots for the various values of $a$ and $b$. Notice that for $a=b=1.$ we get a constant. From then on, as the values increase, we get a curve that looks more and more like a Gaussian.

Is this a Fair Coin? Let's say you visit the casino in Monte Carlo . You want to test your theory that casinos are dubious places where coins have been manipulated to have a larger probability for tails. So you will try to estimate how fair a coin is based on a certain amount of flips. You have no prior opinion on the coin's fairness (i.e. what $p$ might be), and begin flipping the coin. You get either Heads ($H$) or Tails ($T$) as our observed data and want to see if your posterior probabilities change as you obtain more data, that is, more coin flips. A nice way to visualize this is to plot the posterior probabilities as we observe more flips (data). We will be using Bayes rule. $\\textbf{D}$ is our data. \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:bayes} P(\\theta|\\textbf{D}) = \\frac{P(\\textbf{D} |\\theta) P(\\theta) }{P(\\textbf{D})} \\end{equation} In the case of a coin toss when we observe $k$ heads in $n$ tosses: \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:bayes} P(\\theta|\\textbf{k}) = Beta(\\alpha + \\textbf{k}, \\beta + n - \\textbf{k}) \\end{equation} we can say that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ play the roles of a \"prior number of heads\" and \"prior number of tails\".

Introduction to pyMC3 PyMC3 is a Python library for programming Bayesian analysis, and more specifically, data creation, model definition, model fitting, and posterior analysis. It uses the concept of a model which contains assigned parametric statistical distributions to unknown quantities in the model. Within models we define random variables and their distributions. A distribution requires at least a name argument, and other parameters that define it. You may also use the logp() method in the model to build the model log-likelihood function. We define and fit the model. PyMC3 includes a comprehensive set of pre-defined statistical distributions that can be used as model building blocks. Although they are not meant to be used outside of a model , you can invoke them by using the prefix pm , as in pm.Normal . Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Simulations PyMC3 uses the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) and the Random Walk Metropolis , two Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for sampling in posterior space. Monte Carlo gets into the name because when we sample in posterior space, we choose our next move via a pseudo-random process. NUTS is a sophisticated algorithm that can handle a large number of unknown (albeit continuous) variables. In [13]: #help(pm.Poisson) Top 3. Bayesian Linear Regression Defining the Problem Our problem is the following: we want to perform multiple linear regression to predict an outcome variable $Y$ which depends on variables $\\bf{x}_1$ and $\\bf{x}_2$. We will model $Y$ as normally distributed observations with an expected value $mu$ that is a linear function of the two predictor variables, $\\bf{x}_1$ and $\\bf{x}_2$. \\begin{equation} Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\,\\sigma&#94;{2}) \\end{equation} \\begin{equation} \\mu = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\bf{x}_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 \\end{equation} where $\\sigma&#94;2$ represents the measurement error (in this example, we will use $\\sigma&#94;2 = 10$) We also choose the parameters to have normal distributions with those parameters set by us. \\begin{eqnarray} \\beta_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,10) \\\\ \\sigma&#94;2 \\sim |\\mathcal{N}(0,\\,10)| \\end{eqnarray} We will artificially create the data to predict on. We will then see if our model predicts them correctly. Artificially creating some data to test our model.

Defining a Model in PyMC3 In [16]: from pymc3 import Model , Normal , HalfNormal , model_to_graphviz from pymc3 import NUTS , sample , find_MAP from scipy import optimize Building the model Step1: We choose the probability model for our experiment. Y_obs = Normal('Y_obs', mu=mu, sd=sigma, observed=Y) Step2: Choose a prior distributions of the two rates, what we believe the rates were before we observed the data, and the switchpoint. beta0 = Normal('beta0', mu=0, sd=10) # Note: betas is a vector of two variables, b1 and b2, (denoted by shape=2) # so, in array notation, our beta1 = betas[0], and beta2=betas[1] betas = Normal('betas', mu=0, sd=10, shape=2) sigma = HalfNormal('sigma', sd=1) Note: Watch for missing values. Missing values are handled transparently by passing a MaskedArray or a pandas.DataFrame. Behind the scenes, another random variable, disasters.missing_values is created to model the missing values. If you pass a np.array with missing values you will get an error. In [17]: with Model () as my_linear_model : # Priors for unknown model parameters, specifically created stochastic random variables # with Normal prior distributions for the regression coefficients, # and a half-normal distribution for the standard deviation of the observations. # These are our parameters. beta0 = Normal ( 'beta0' , mu = 0 , sd = 10 ) # Note: betas is a vector of two variables, b1 and b2, (denoted by shape=2) # so, in array notation, our beta1 = betas[0], and beta2=betas[1] betas = Normal ( 'betas' , mu = 0 , sd = 10 , shape = 2 ) sigma = HalfNormal ( 'sigma' , sd = 1 ) # mu is what is called a deterministic random variable, which implies that its value is completely # determined by its parents' values (betas and sigma in our case). # There is no uncertainty in the variable beyond that which is inherent in the parents' values mu = beta0 + betas [ 0 ] * x1 + betas [ 1 ] * x2 # Likelihood function = how probable is my observed data? # This is a special case of a stochastic variable that we call an observed stochastic. # It is identical to a standard stochastic, except that its observed argument, # which passes the data to the variable, indicates that the values for this variable were observed, # and should not be changed by any fitting algorithm applied to the model. # The data can be passed in the form of either a numpy.ndarray or pandas.DataFrame object. Y_obs = Normal ( 'Y_obs' , mu = mu , sd = sigma , observed = Y ) Note: If our problem was a classification for which we would use Logistic regression see below In [18]: ## do not worry about this, it's just a nice graph to have ## you need to install python-graphviz first # conda install -c conda-forge python-graphviz model_to_graphviz ( my_linear_model ) Out[18]: %3 cluster2 2 cluster100 100 beta0 beta0 ~ Normal Y_obs Y_obs ~ Normal beta0->Y_obs sigma sigma ~ HalfNormal sigma->Y_obs betas betas ~ Normal betas->Y_obs Fitting the Model with MAP (FYI, we will not directly use this method) In Bayesian analysis we have our prior(s) , we define our likelihood , and, having specified our model , we try to calculate posterior estimates for the unknown variables in the model. We could try to calculate the posterior estimates analytically, but for most the models, this is not feasible. What we do then is compute summaries based on samples drawn from the posterior distribution using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods. \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:beta} P(\\theta|\\textbf{D}) \\rightarrow \\{\\theta_1,....\\theta_n\\} \\end{equation} Then we can find any estimate we want by using these samples, for example: \\begin{equation} \\mathbb{E}[f(\\theta] = \\int d\\theta{p(\\theta) f(\\theta)} \\end{equation} So we calculate the maximum a posteriori (MAP) point using optimization methods. \\begin{equation} f(\\hat{\\theta}), \\hat{\\theta} = argmax ({p(\\theta))} \\end{equation} The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate for a model, is the mode of the posterior distribution and is generally found using numerical optimization methods. This is often fast and easy to do, but only gives a point estimate for the parameters and can be biased if the mode isn't representative of the distribution. PyMC3 provides this functionality with the find_MAP function. MAP estimate is not always reasonable, especially if the mode is at an extreme or we have a multimodal distribution, or we have high dimensional posteriors. This will often occur in hierarchical models with the variance parameter for the random effect. If the individual group means are all the same, the posterior will have near infinite density if the variance parameter for the group means is almost zero. Most techniques for finding the MAP estimate only find a local optimium (which is often good enough), and can therefore fail badly for multimodal posteriors, as mentioned above. To solve these issues we turn to sampling as our method for finding the posterior. You do not have to worry about MAP in our problems. Our pyMC3 models use the MAP method to initialize the variables under the hood and we do not have to explicitly set this. Fitting the Model with Sampling - Doing Inference See below for PyMC3's sampling method. As you can see it has quite a few parameters. Most of them are set to default values by the package. For some, it's useful to set your own values. pymc3.sampling.sample(draws=500, step=None, init='auto', n_init=200000, start=None, trace=None, chain_idx=0, chains=None, cores=None, tune=500, progressbar=True, model=None, random_seed=None, discard_tuned_samples=True, compute_convergence_checks=True, **kwargs) Parameters to set: draws (int): number of samples to draw, defaults to 500. tune (int): number of iterations to tune, defaults to 500. target_accept (float in $[0, 1]$). The step size is tuned such that we approximate this acceptance rate. Higher values like 0.9 or 0.95 often work better for problematic posteriors. (optional) cores (int) number of chains to run in parallel, defaults to the number of CPUs in the system, but at most 4. pm.sample returns a pymc3.backends.base.MultiTrace object that contains the samples. We usually name it trace . All the information about the posterior is in trace , which also provides statistics about the sampler.

Hierarchical Models Gelman et al. famous radon dataset is a classic for hierarchical modeling. In this dataset the amount of the radioactive gas radon has been measured among different households in all county's of several states. Radon gas is known to be the highest cause of lung cancer in non-smokers. It is believed to be more strongly present in households containing a basement and to differ in amount present among types of soil. Here we'll investigate this differences and try to make predictions of radonlevels in different county's based on the county itself and the presence of a basement.

If the problem above was a classification that required a Logistic Regression, we would use the logistic function ( where $\\beta_0$ is the intercept, and $\\beta_i$ (i=1, 2, 3) determines the shape of the logistic function). \\begin{equation} Pr(Y=1|X_1,X_2,X3) = {\\frac{1}{1 + exp&#94;{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\beta_3X_3)}}} \\end{equation} Since both $\\beta_0$ and the $\\beta_i$s can be any possitive or negative number, we can model them as gaussian random variables. \\begin{eqnarray} \\beta_0 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\,\\sigma&#94;2) \\\\ \\beta_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_i,\\,\\sigma_i&#94;2) \\end{eqnarray} In PyMC3 we can model those as: pm.Normal('beta_0', mu=0, sigma=100) (where $\\mu$ and $\\sigma&#94;2$ can have some initial values that we assign them, e.g. 0 and 100) The dererministic variable would be: p-logit = beta0 + beta_1 * X_1 + beta_2 * X_2 + beta_3 * X_3 To connect this variable (p_logit) with our observed data, we would use a Bernoulli as our likelihood. our_likelihood = pm.Bernoulli('our_likelihood', logit_p=p-logit, observed=our_data) Notice that the main difference with Linear Regression is the use of a Bernoulli distribution instead of a Gaussian distribution, and the use of the logistic function instead of the identity function. Note: we could explicitly create this variable using pm.Deterministic. mu = pm.Deterministic('mu', beta0 + beta_1*X_1 + beta_2*X_2 + beta_3*X_3) In [55]: # A reminder of what the logistic function looks like. # Play with parameters a and b to see the shape of the curve change b = 5. x = np . linspace ( - 8 , 8 , 100 ) plt . plot ( x , 1 / ( 1 + np . exp ( - b * x ))) plt . xlabel ( 'y' ) plt . ylabel ( 'y=logistic(x)' ) Out[55]: Text(0, 0.5, 'y=logistic(x)') References : Salvatier J, Wiecki TV, Fonnesbeck C. 2016.

Apply Bayes Rule in calculating probabilities. Understand how to apply Bayesian analysis using PyMC3 Avoid getting fired when talking to your Bayesian employer. This lab corresponds to Lectures 6, 7, and 8, and maps to Homework 3. Table of Contents The Bayesian Way of Thinking or Is this a Fair Coin? Intro to pyMC3 . Bayesian Linear Regression . Try this at Home: Example on Mining Disasters . 1. The Bayesian way of Thinking Here is my state of knowledge about the situation. Here is some data, I am now going to revise my state of knowledge. Table Exercise : Discuss the statement above with your table mates and make sure everyone understands what it means and what constitutes Bayesian way of thinking. Finally, count the Bayesians among you. A. Bayes Rule \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:bayes} P(A|\\textbf{B}) = \\frac{P(\\textbf{B} |A) P(A) }{P(\\textbf{B})} \\end{equation} $P(A|\\textbf{B})$ is the posterior distribution, prob(hypothesis | data) $P(\\textbf{B} |A)$ is the likelihood function, how probable is my data B for different values of the parameters $P(A)$ is the marginal probability to observe the data, called the prior , this captures our belief about the data before observing it. $P(\\textbf{B})$ is the marginal distribution (sometimes called marginal likelihood) Table Exercise : Solve the Monty Hall Paradox using Bayes Rule. You are invited to play a game. There are 3 doors behind one of which are the keys to a brand new red Tesla. There is a goat behind each of the other two. You are asked to pick one door, and let's say you pick Door1 . The host knows where the keys are. Of the two remaining closed doors, he will always open the door that has a goat behind it. He'll say \"I will do you a favor and open Door2 \". So he opens Door2 inside which there is, of course, a goat. He now asks you, do you want to open the initial Door you chose or change to Door3 ? Generally, in this game, when you are presented with this choice should you swap the doors? Initial Steps: Start by defining the events of this probabilities game. One definition is: $A_i$: car is behind door $i$ $B_i$ host opens door $i$ $i\\in[1,2,3]$ In more math terms, the question is: is the probability that the price is behind Door 1 higher than the probability that the price is behind Door2 , given that an event has occured ? B. Bayes Rule written with Probability Distributions We have data that we believe come from an underlying distribution of unknown parameters. If we find those parameters, we know everything about the process that generated this data and we can make inferences (create new data). \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:bayes} P(\\theta|\\textbf{D}) = \\frac{P(\\textbf{D} |\\theta) P(\\theta) }{P(\\textbf{D})} \\end{equation} But what is $\\theta \\;$? $\\theta$ is an unknown yet fixed set of parameters. In Bayesian inference we express our belief about what $\\theta$ might be and instead of trying to guess $\\theta$ exactly, we look for its probability distribution . What that means is that we are looking for the parameters of that distribution. For example, for a Poisson distribution our $\\theta$ is only $\\lambda$. In a normal distribution, our $\\theta$ is often just $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$. C. A review of Common Probability Distributions Discrete Distributions The random variable has a probability mass function (pmf) which measures the probability that our random variable will take a specific value $y$, denoted $P(Y=y)$. Bernoulli (binary outcome, success has probability $\\theta$, $one$ trial): $ P(Y=k) = \\theta&#94;k(1-\\theta)&#94;{1-k} $ Binomial (binary outcome, success has probability $\\theta$, $n$ trials): \\begin{equation} P(Y=k) = {{n}\\choose{k}} \\cdot \\theta&#94;k(1-\\theta)&#94;{n-k} \\end{equation} Note : Binomial(1,$p$) = Bernouli($p$) Negative Binomial Poisson (counts independent events occurring at a rate) \\begin{equation} P\\left( Y=y|\\lambda \\right) = \\frac{{e&#94;{ - \\lambda } \\lambda &#94;y }}{{y!}} \\end{equation} y = 0,1,2,... Discrete Uniform Categorical, or Multinulli (random variables can take any of K possible categories, each having its own probability; this is a generalization of the Bernoulli distribution for a discrete variable with more than two possible outcomes, such as the roll of a die) Dirichlet-multinomial (a generalization of the beta distribution for many variables) Continuous Distributions The random variable has a probability density function (pdf) . Uniform (variable equally likely to be near each value in interval $(a,b)$) \\begin{equation} P(X = x) = \\frac{1}{b - a} \\end{equation} anywhere within the interval $(a, b)$, and zero elsewhere. Normal (a.k.a. Gaussian) \\begin{equation} X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\,\\sigma&#94;{2}) \\end{equation} A Normal distribution can be parameterized either in terms of precision $\\tau$ or standard deviation ($\\sigma&#94;{2}$. The link between the two is given by \\begin{equation} \\tau = \\frac{1}{\\sigma&#94;{2}} \\end{equation} Mean $\\mu$ Variance $\\frac{1}{\\tau}$ or $\\sigma&#94;{2}$ Parameters: mu: float , sigma: float or tau: float Beta (variable ($\\theta$) taking on values in the interval $[0,1]$, and parametrized by two positive parameters, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ that control the shape of the distribution. Note: Beta is a good distribution to use for priors (beliefs) because its range is $[0,1]$ which is the natural range for a probability and because we can model a wide range of functions by changing the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ parameters. \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:beta} P(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{B(\\alpha, \\beta)} {\\theta}&#94;{\\alpha - 1} (1 - \\theta)&#94;{\\beta - 1} \\propto {\\theta}&#94;{\\alpha - 1} (1 - \\theta)&#94;{\\beta - 1} \\end{equation} where the normalisation constant, $B$, is a beta function of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, \\begin{equation} B(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\int_{t=0}&#94;1 t&#94;{\\alpha - 1} (1 - t)&#94;{\\beta - 1} dt. \\end{equation} Exponential Gamma Code Resources: Statistical Distributions in numpy/scipy: scipy.stats Statistical Distributions in pyMC3: distributions in PyMC3 (we will see those below). Exercise: Plot a Discrete variable Change the value of $\\mu$ in the Poisson PMF and see how the plot changes. Remember that the y-axis in a discrete probability distribution shows the probability of the random variable having a specific value in the x-axis. \\begin{equation} P\\left( X=k \\right) = \\frac{{e&#94;{ - \\mu } \\mu &#94;k }}{{k!}} \\end{equation} stats.poisson.pmf(x, mu) $\\mu$(mu) is our $\\theta$ in this case.

Remember that the y-axis in a continuous probability distribution does not shows the actual probability of the random variable having a specific value in the x-axis because that probability is zero!. Instead, to see the probability that the variable is within a small margin we look at the integral below the curve of the PDF. The uniform is often used as a noninformative prior. Uniform - numpy.random.uniform(a=0.0, b=1.0, size) $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are our parameters. size is how many tries to perform. Our $\\theta$ is basically the combination of the parameters a,b.

Is this a Fair Coin? We do not want to promote gambling but let's say you visit the casino in Monte Carlo . You want to test your theory that casinos are dubious places where coins have been manipulated to have a larger probability for tails. So you will try to estimate how fair a coin is based on 100 flips. You begin by flipping the coin. You get either Heads ($H$) or Tails ($T$) as our observed data and want to see if your posterior probabilities change as you obtain more data, that is, more coin flips. A nice way to visualize this is to plot the posterior probabilities as we observe more flips (data). We will be using Bayes rule. $\\textbf{D}$ is our data. \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:bayes} P(\\theta|\\textbf{D}) = \\frac{P(\\textbf{D} |\\theta) P(\\theta) }{P(\\textbf{D})} \\end{equation} In the case of a coin toss when we observe $k$ heads in $n$ tosses: \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:bayes} P(\\theta|\\textbf{k}) = Beta(\\alpha + \\textbf{k}, \\beta + n - \\textbf{k}) \\end{equation} we can say that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ play the roles of a \"prior number of heads\" and \"prior number of tails\".

Introduction to pyMC3 PyMC3 is a Python library for programming Bayesian analysis, and more specifically, data creation, model definition, model fitting, and posterior analysis. It uses the concept of a model which contains assigned parametric statistical distributions to unknown quantities in the model. Within models we define random variables and their distributions. A distribution requires at least a name argument, and other parameters that define it. You may also use the logp() method in the model to build the model log-likelihood function. We define and fit the model. PyMC3 includes a comprehensive set of pre-defined statistical distributions that can be used as model building blocks. Although they are not meant to be used outside of a model , you can invoke them by using the prefix pm , as in pm.Normal . Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Simulations PyMC3 uses the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) and the Random Walk Metropolis , two Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for sampling in posterior space. Monte Carlo gets into the name because when we sample in posterior space, we choose our next move via a pseudo-random process. NUTS is a sophisticated algorithm that can handle a large number of unknown (albeit continuous) variables. In [ ]: with pm . Model () as model : z = pm .

Bayesian Linear Regression Let's say we want to predict outcomes Y as normally distributed observations with an expected value $mu$ that is a linear function of two predictor variables, $\\bf{x}_1$ and $\\bf{x}_2$. \\begin{equation} \\mu = \\alpha + \\beta_1 \\bf{x}_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 \\end{equation}\\begin{equation} Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\,\\sigma&#94;{2}) \\end{equation} where $\\sigma&#94;2$ represents the measurement error. In this example, we will use $\\sigma&#94;2 = 10$ We also choose the parameters as normal distributions: \\begin{eqnarray} \\alpha \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,10) \\\\ \\beta_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\,10) \\\\ \\sigma&#94;2 \\sim |\\mathcal{N}(0,\\,10)| \\end{eqnarray} We will artificially create the data to predict on. We will then see if our model predicts them correctly.

Occurrences of disasters in the time series is thought to follow a Poisson process with a large rate parameter in the early part of the time series, and from one with a smaller rate in the later part. We are interested in locating the change point in the series, which perhaps is related to changes in mining safety regulations. disasters = pm.Poisson('disasters', rate, observed=disaster_data) We have two rates, early_rate if $t<=s$, and late_rate if $t>s$, where $s$ is the year the switch was made (a.k.a. the switchpoint ). Step2: Choose a prior distributions of the two rates, what we believe the rates were before we observed the data, and the switchpoint. We choose Exponential. early_rate = pm.Exponential('early_rate', 1) The parameters of this model are: Note: Watch for missing values. Missing values are handled transparently by passing a MaskedArray or a pandas.DataFrame. Behind the scenes, another random variable, disasters.missing_values is created to model the missing values. If you pass a np.array with missing values you will get an error. In [ ]: with pm . Model () as disaster_model : # discrete switchpoint = pm . DiscreteUniform ( 'switchpoint' , lower = years . min (), upper = years . max (), testval = 1900 ) # Priors for pre- and post-switch rates number of disasters early_rate = pm .

In the late period it seems to be between 0.6 and 1.2 so definitely lower. The right side plots show the samples we drew to come to our conclusion.

Table of Contents PCA Refresher Distant Metrics Clustering Algorithms and Measuring Quality of Clusters 1. PCA Refresher Discussion #1 What is PCA? How can it be useful? How to use it ( via sklearn ): # assume we a DataFrame df a. Instantiate a new PCA object : pca_transformer = PCA() b. Fit some data (learns the transformation based on this data) : fitted_pca = pca_transformer.fit(df) c. Transform the data to the reduced dimensions : pca_df = fitted_pca.transform(df) Using two distinct steps (i.e., (b) and (c)) to fit and transform our data allows one the flexibility to transform any dataset according to our learned fit() . Alternatively, if you know you only want to transform a single dataset, you can combine (b) and (c) into one step: Fit and transform : pca_df = pca_transformer.fit_transform(df) Example: In [3]: ms_df = pd . read_csv ( \"../data/multishapes.csv\" )[[ 'x' , 'y' ]] # loads x,y columns of a dataset pca_transformer = PCA () fitted_pca = pca_transformer . fit ( ms_df ) pca_df = fitted_pca . transform ( ms_df ) NOTE: The above PCA transformation is a bit silly because we started with 2 dimensions and are transforming it to 2 dimensions -- no reduction. The data is still transforming the original data by applying a linear transformation so as to capture the most variance, but PCA is even more useful when the original data is high-dimensional. This example was just to remind you of the syntax. Discussion #2: We didn't scale our data before applying PCA. Should we usually do so? Why or why not? 2. Distance Metrics In the picture below, we are concerned with measuring the distance between two points, p and q . (edited from Wikipedia.org) Euclidean Distance: The Euclidean distance measures the shortest path between the two points, navigating through all dimensions: Manhattan Distance: The Manhattan distance measures the cumulative difference between the two points, across all dimensions. Discussion #3: Where have we seen something like this before in CS109A? What are the effects of using one versus another? Hamming Distance (extra credit): If our two elements of comparison can be represented a sequence of discrete items, it can be useful to measure how many of their elements differ. For example: Mahmoud and Mahmood differ by just 1 character and thus have a hamming distance of 1. 10101 and 01101 have a hamming distance of 2. Mary and Barry have a hamming distance of 3 (m->b, y->r, null->y). Note: the last example may seem sub-optimal, as we could transform Mary to Barry by just 2 operations (substituting the M with a B, then adding an 'r'). The very related Levenshtein distance can handle this, and thus tends to be more appropriate for Strings. 3. Clustering Algorithms Question: Why do we care about clustering? How/why is it useful? We will now walk through three clustering algorithms, first discussing them at a high-level, then showing how to implement them with Python libraries. Let's first load and scale our data, so that particular dimensions don't naturally dominate in their contributions in the distant calculations: In [4]: # loads and displays our summary statistics of our data multishapes = pd . read_csv ( \"../data/multishapes.csv\" ) ms_df = multishapes [[ 'x' , 'y' ]] ms_df . describe () Out[4]: .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } x y count 1100.000000 1100.000000 mean -0.081222 -0.625431 std 0.644967 1.176170 min -1.489180 -3.353462 25% -0.478839 -1.126752 50% -0.132920 -0.297040 75% 0.366072 0.250817 max 1.492208 1.253874 In [5]: # scales our data scaled_df = pd . DataFrame ( preprocessing . scale ( ms_df ), index = multishapes [ 'shape' ], columns = ms_df . columns ) scaled_df . describe () Out[5]: .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } x y count 1.100000e+03 1100.000000 mean 6.459479e-18 0.000000 std 1.000455e+00 1.000455 min -2.183985e+00 -2.320473 25% -6.167723e-01 -0.426425 50% -8.019252e-02 0.279331 75% 6.938298e-01 0.745340 max 2.440659e+00 1.598544 In [6]: # plots our data msplot = scaled_df . plot . scatter ( x = 'x' , y = 'y' , c = 'Black' , title = \"Multishapes data\" , figsize = ( 11 , 8.5 )) msplot . set_xlabel ( \"X\" ) msplot . set_ylabel ( \"Y\" ) plt . show () 3a. k-Means clustering: Table Exercise #1 : With your table, collectively discuss how k-means works. Use a whiteboard, draw a bunch of dots, and walk through each step of how the algorithm works. When you're confident of your answer, speak with a TF to verify its correctness. Code (via sklearn ): In [7]: from sklearn.cluster import KMeans ms_kmeans = KMeans ( n_clusters = 3 , init = 'random' , n_init = 3 , random_state = 109 ) . fit ( scaled_df ) That's it! Just 1 line of code! Now that we've run k-Means, we can look at various attributes of our clusters. Full documenation is here . In [8]: display ( ms_kmeans . cluster_centers_ ) display ( ms_kmeans . labels_ [ 0 : 10 ]) array([[ 1.06623356, 0.17403387], [-0.46343097, 0.54170897], [-0.98352608, -1.57663916]]) array([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=int32) Plotting Take note of matplotlib's c= argument to color items in the plot, along with our stacking two different plotting functions in the same plot. In [9]: plt . figure ( figsize = ( 10 , 10 )) plt . scatter ( scaled_df [ 'x' ], scaled_df [ 'y' ], c = ms_kmeans . labels_ ); plt . scatter ( ms_kmeans . cluster_centers_ [:, 0 ], ms_kmeans . cluster_centers_ [:, 1 ], c = 'r' , marker = 'h' , s = 100 ); Question : Is this expected or did something go wrong? Should we always scale our data before clustering? Lessons: Initializations matter; run multiple times Total Squared distance should never get worse during an update k-Means can struggle with clusters that are close together; they can get lumped into one There's no notion of 'not part of any cluster' or 'part of two clusters' Visualization here Quality of Clusters: Inertia Inertia measures the total squared distance from points to their cluster's centroid. We obviously want this distance to be relatively small. If we increase the number of clusters, it will naturally make the average distance smaller. If every point has its own cluster, then our distance would be 0. That's obviously not an ideal way to cluster. One way to determine a reasonable number of clusters to simply try many different clusterings as we vary k , and each time, measure the overall inertia. In [10]: wss = [] for i in range ( 1 , 11 ): fitx = KMeans ( n_clusters = i , init = 'random' , n_init = 5 , random_state = 109 ) . fit ( scaled_df ) wss . append ( fitx . inertia_ ) plt . figure ( figsize = ( 11 , 8.5 )) plt . plot ( range ( 1 , 11 ), wss , 'bx-' ) plt . xlabel ( 'Number of clusters $k$' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Inertia' ) plt . title ( 'The Elbow Method showing the optimal $k$' ) plt . show () Look for the place(s) where distance stops decreasing as much (i.e., the 'elbow' of the curve). It seems that 4 would be a good number of clusters, as a higher k yields diminishing returns. Quality of Clusters: Silhouette Let's say we have a data point $i$, and the cluster it belongs to is referred to as $C(i)$. One way to measure the quality of a cluster $C(i)$ is to measure how close its data points are to each other (within-cluster) compared to nearby, other clusters $C(j)$. This is what Silhouette Scores provide for us. The range is [-1,1]; 0 indicates a point on the decision boundary (equal average closeness to points intra-cluster and out-of-cluster), and negative values mean that datum might be better in a different cluster. Specifically, let $a(i)$ denote the average distance data point $i$ is to the other points in the same cluster: Similarly, we can also compute the average distance that data point $i$ is to all other clusters. The cluster that yields the minimum distance is denoted by $b(i)$: Hopefully our data point $i$ is much closer, on average, to points within its own cluster (i.e., $a(i)$ than it is to its closest neighboring cluster $b(i)$). The silhouette score quantifies this as $s(i)$: NOTE: If data point $i$ belongs to its own cluster (no other points), then the silhouette score is set to 0 (otherwise, $a(i)$ would be undefined). The silhouette score plotted below is the overall average across all points in our dataset. The silhouette_score() function is available in sklearn . We can manually loop over values of K (for applying k-Means algorithm), then plot its silhouette score. This should allow us to make a reasonable choice for selecting the 'optimal' number of clusters.

In [14]: # your code here # %load solutions/exercise1-solution.py Quality of Clusters: Gap Statistic The gap statistic compares within-cluster distances (like in silhouette), but instead of comparing against the second-best existing cluster for that point, it compares our clustering's overall average to the average we'd see if the data were generated at random (we'd expect randomly generated data to not necessarily have any inherit patterns that can be easily clustered). For full details, you can read the original research paper. In essence, the within-cluster distances (in the elbow plot) will go down just becuse we have more clusters. We additionally calculate how much they'd go down on non-clustered data with the same spread as our data and subtract that trend out to produce the plot below.

Agglomerative Clustering Table Exercise #2 : With your table, collectively discuss how agglomerative clustering works. Use a whiteboard, draw a bunch of dots, and walk through each step of how the algorithm works. When you're confident of your answer, speak with a TF to verify its correctness. Code (via scipy ): There are many different cluster-merging criteria, one of which is Ward's criteria. Ward's optimizes having the lowest total within-cluster distances, so it merges the two clusters that will harm this objective least. scipy 's agglomerative clustering function implements Ward's method. In [19]: import scipy.cluster.hierarchy as hac from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist plt . figure ( figsize = ( 11 , 8.5 )) dist_mat = pdist ( scaled_df , metric = \"euclidean\" ) ward_data = hac . ward ( dist_mat ) hac . dendrogram ( ward_data ); Discussion #4 : How do you read a plot like the above? What are valid options for number of clusters, and how can you tell? Are some more valid than others? Does it make sense to compute silhouette scores for an agglomerative clustering? If we wanted to compute silhouette scores, what would we need for this to be possible? Lessons: It's expensive: O(n&#94;3) time complexity and O(n&#94;2) space complexity. Many choices for linkage criteria Every node gets clustered (no child left behind) In [20]: # %load solutions/discussion4-solution.py 3c. DBscan Clustering DBscan uses an intuitive notion of denseness to define clusters, rather than defining clusters by a central point as in k-means. Code (via sklearn ): DBscan is implemented in good 'ol sklearn, but there aren't great automated tools for searching for the optimal epsilon parameter. For full documentation, please visit this page In [21]: from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN plt . figure ( figsize = ( 11 , 8.5 )) fitted_dbscan = DBSCAN ( eps = 0.2 ) . fit ( scaled_df ) plt . scatter ( scaled_df [ 'x' ], scaled_df [ 'y' ], c = fitted_dbscan . labels_ ); Note: the dark purple dots are not clustered with anything else. They are lone singletons. You can validate such by setting epsilon to a very small value, and increase the min_samples to a high value. Under these conditions, nothing would cluster, and yet all dots become dark purple. Exercise #2 : Experiment with the above code by changing its epsilon value and the min_samples (what is the default value for it, since the above code doesn't specify a value?) Instead of just empirically observing how the epsilon value affects the clustering (which would be very costly for large, high-dimensional data), we can also inspect how far each data point is to its $N&#94;{th}$ closest neighbor: In [22]: from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors # x-axis is each individual data point, numbered by an artificial index # y-axis is the distance to its 2nd closest neighbor def plot_epsilon ( df , min_samples ): fitted_neigbors = NearestNeighbors ( n_neighbors = min_samples ) . fit ( df ) distances , indices = fitted_neigbors . kneighbors ( df ) dist_to_nth_nearest_neighbor = distances [:, - 1 ] plt . plot ( np . sort ( dist_to_nth_nearest_neighbor )) plt . xlabel ( \"Index \\n (sorted by increasing distances)\" ) plt . ylabel ( \" {} -NN Distance (epsilon)\" . format ( min_samples - 1 )) plt . tick_params ( right = True , labelright = True ) In [23]: plot_epsilon ( scaled_df , 3 ) Lessons: Can cluster non-linear relationships very well; potential for more natural, arbritrarily shaped groupings Does not require specifying the # of clusters (i.e., k ); the algorithm determines such Robust to outliers Very sensitive to the parameters (requires strong knowledge of the data) Doesn't guarantee that every (or ANY) item will be clustered Discussion #5 : When should we prefer one type of clustering over another? Should we always just try all of them? Imagine you work at Spotify and you want to create personalized playlists for each person. One could imagine a dataset exists whereby each row is a particular song, and the columns are features (e.g., tempo (BPM), average vocal frequency, amount of bass, sentiment of lyrics, duration in seconds, etc). Let's use clustering to group one's catalog of favorite music, which will serve as disjoint starting points for suggesting future songs. Specifically, imagine that you've 'liked' 500 songs on Spotify so far, and your recommendation algorithm needs to cluster those 500 songs. Would you first experiment with k-Means, Agglomerative, or DBScan?

This lab corresponds to lectures 1, 2, and 3 and maps to homework 1. Table of Contents 1 - Overview - A Top View of LMs, GLMs, and GAMs to set the stage 2 - A review of Linear Regression with statsmodels . What are those weird formulas? 3 - Splines 4 - Generative Additive Models with pyGAM 5 - Smooting Splines using pyGAM Overview Linear Models (LM), Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), Splines, Natural Splines, Smoothing Splines! So many definitions. Let's try and work through an example for each of them so we can better understand them. image source: Dani Servén Marín (one of the developers of pyGAM) A - Linear Models First we have the Linear Models which you know from 109a. These models are linear in the coefficients. Very interpretable but suffer from high bias because let's face it, few relationships in life are linear. Simple Linear Regression (defined as a model with one predictor) as well as Multiple Linear Regression (more than one predictors) are examples of LMs. Polynomial Regression extends the linear model by adding terms that are still linear for the coefficients but non-linear when it somes to the predictiors which are now raised in a power or multiplied between them. $$ \\begin{aligned} y = \\beta{_0} + \\beta{_1}{x_1} & \\mbox{(simple linear regression)}\\\\ y = \\beta{_0} + \\beta{_1}{x_1} + \\beta{_2}{x_2} + \\beta{_3}{x_3} & \\mbox{(multiple linear regression)}\\\\ y = \\beta{_0} + \\beta{_1}{x_1} + \\beta{_2}{x_1&#94;2} + \\beta{_3}{x_3&#94;3} & \\mbox{(polynomial regression)}\\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ Discussion What does it mean for a model to be interpretable ? Are linear regression models interpretable? Are random forests? What about Neural Networks such as FFNs and CNNs? Do we always want interpretability? Describe cases where we do and cases where we do not care. B - Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) $$ \\begin{aligned} y = \\beta{_0} + \\beta{_1}{x_1} + \\beta{_2}{x_2} + \\beta{_3}{x_3} \\end{aligned} $$ Generalized Linear Models is a term coined in the early 1970s by Nelder and Wedderburn for a class of models that includes both Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. A GLM fits one coefficient per feature (predictor). C - Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) Hastie and Tidshirani coined the term Generalized Additive Models in 1986 for a class of non-linear extensions to Generalized Linear Models. $$ \\begin{aligned} y = \\beta{_0} + f_1\\left(x_1\\right) + f_2\\left(x_2\\right) + f_3\\left(x_3\\right) \\\\ y = \\beta{_0} + f_1\\left(x_1\\right) + f_2\\left(x_2, x_3\\right) + f_3\\left(x_3\\right) & \\mbox{(with interaction terms)} \\end{aligned} $$ In practice we add splines and regularization via smoothing penalties to our GLMs. Decision Trees also fit in this category. image source: Dani Servén Marín D - Basis Functions In our models we can use various types of functions as \"basis\". Monomials such as $x&#94;2$, $x&#94;4$ ( Polynomial Regression ) Sigmoid functions (neural networks) Fourier functions Wavelets Regression splines which we will look at shortly. Discussion Where does polynomial regression fit in all this? Answer: GLMs include Polynomial Regression so the graphic above should really include curved lines, not just straight... Implementation 1 - Linear/Polynomial Regression We will use the diabetes dataset. Variables are: subject: subject ID number age: age diagnosed with diabetes acidity: a measure of acidity called base deficit Response: y: natural log of serum C-peptide concentration Original source is Sockett et al. (1987) mentioned in Hastie and Tibshirani's book \"Generalized Additive Models\".

As you remember from 109a, we have two tools for Linear Regression: statsmodels https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/regression.html , and sklearn https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html Previously, we worked from a vector of target values and a design matrix we built ourself (e.g. using sklearn 's PolynomialFeatures). statsmodels allows users to fit statistical models using R-style formulas . They build the target value and design matrix for you. # our target variable is 'Lottery', while 'Region' is a categorical predictor df = dta.data[['Lottery', 'Literacy', 'Wealth', 'Region']] formula='Lottery ~ Literacy + Wealth + C(Region) + Literacy * Wealth' For more on these formulas see: https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/notebooks/generated/formulas.html https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html In [7]: import statsmodels.formula.api as sm model1 = sm . ols ( 'y ~ age' , data = diab ) fit1_lm = model1 . fit () Let's build a dataframe to predict values on (sometimes this is just the test or validation set).

A spline of degree k is a piecewise polynomial that is continuously differentiable k − 1 times. Splines are the basis of CAD software and vector graphics including a lot of the fonts used in your computer. The name \"spline\" comes from a tool used by ship designers to draw smooth curves. Here is the letter $epsilon$ written with splines: font idea inspired by David Knezevic (AM205) If the degree is 1 then we have a Linear Spline. If it is 3 then we have a Cubic spline. It turns out that cubic splines because they have a continous 2nd derivative at the knots are very smoothly looking to the eye. We do not need higher order than that. The Cubic Splines are usually Natural Cubic Splines which means they have the added constrain of the end points' second derivative = 0. We will use the CubicSpline and the B-Spline as well as the Linear Spline. scipy.interpolate See all the different splines that scipy.interpolate has to offer: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/interpolate.html Let's use the simplest form which is interpolate on a set of points and then find the points between them. In [14]: from scipy.interpolate import splrep , splev from scipy.interpolate import BSpline , CubicSpline from scipy.interpolate import interp1d # define the range of the function a = - 1 b = 1 # define the number of knots num_knots = 10 x = np . linspace ( a , b , num_knots ) # define the function we want to approximate y = 1 / ( 1 + 25 * ( x ** 2 )) # make a linear spline linspline = interp1d ( x , y ) # sample at these points to plot xx = np . linspace ( a , b , 1000 ) yy = 1 / ( 1 + 25 * ( xx ** 2 )) plt . plot ( x , y , '*' ) plt . plot ( xx , yy , label = 'true function' ) plt . plot ( xx , linspline ( xx ), label = 'linear spline' ); plt . legend (); Exercise 2 The Linear interpolation does not look very good. Fit a Cubic Spline and plot along the Linear to compare. In [15]: # your answer here In [16]: # %load ../solutions/exercise2.py # define the range of the function a = - 1 b = 1 # define the knots num_knots = 10 x = np . linspace ( a , b , num_knots ) # define the function we want to approximate y = 1 / ( 1 + 25 * ( x ** 2 )) # make the Cubic spline cubspline = CubicSpline ( x , y ) # OR make a linear spline linspline = interp1d ( x , y ) # plot xx = np . linspace ( a , b , 1000 ) yy = 1 / ( 1 + 25 * ( xx ** 2 )) plt . plot ( xx , yy , label = 'true function' ) plt . plot ( x , y , '*' ) plt . plot ( xx , linspline ( xx ), label = 'linear' ); plt . plot ( xx , cubspline ( xx ), label = 'cubic' ); plt . legend (); Discussion Change the number of knots to 100 and see what happens. What would happen if we run a polynomial model of degree equal to the number of knots (a global one as in polynomial regression, not a spline)? What makes a spline 'Natural'? B-Splines A B-splines (Basis Splines) is defined by a set of control points and a set of basis functions that intepolate (fit) the function between these points. By choosing to have no smoothing factor we forces the final B-spline to pass though all the points. If, on the other hand, we set a smothing factor, our function is more of an approximation with the control points as \"guidance\". The latter produced a smoother curve which is prefferable for drawing software. For more on Splines see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline ) We will use scipy.splrep to calulate the coefficients for the B-Spline and draw it.

The winner will always be a continuous, cubic polynomial with a knot at each data point. Let's see how this smoothing works in pyGAM . We start by creating some arbitrary data and fitting them with a GAM. In [30]: X = np . linspace ( 0 , 10 , 500 ) y = np . sin ( X * 2 * np . pi ) * X + np . random . randn ( len ( X )) plt . scatter ( X , y ); In [31]: # let's try a large lambda first and lots of splines gam = LinearGAM ( lam = 1e6 , n_splines = 50 ) . fit ( X , y ) XX = gam . generate_X_grid ( term = 0 ) plt . scatter ( X , y , alpha = 0.3 ); plt . plot ( XX , gam . predict ( XX )); We see that the large $\\lambda$ forces a straight line, no flexibility. Let's see now what happens if we make it smaller. In [32]: # let's try a smaller lambda gam = LinearGAM ( lam = 1e2 , n_splines = 50 ) . fit ( X , y ) XX = gam . generate_X_grid ( term = 0 ) plt . scatter ( X , y , alpha = 0.3 ); plt . plot ( XX , gam . predict ( XX )); There is some curvature there but still not a good fit. Let's try no penalty. That should have the line fit exactly. In [33]: # no penalty, let's try a 0 lambda gam = LinearGAM ( lam = 0 , n_splines = 50 ) . fit ( X , y ) XX = gam . generate_X_grid ( term = 0 ) plt . scatter ( X , y , alpha = 0.3 ) plt . plot ( XX , gam . predict ( XX )) Out[33]: [ ] Yes, that is good. Now let's see what happens if we lessen the number of splines. The fit should not be as good. In [34]: # no penalty, let's try a 0 lambda gam = LinearGAM ( lam = 0 , n_splines = 10 ) . fit ( X , y ) XX = gam . generate_X_grid ( term = 0 ) plt . scatter ( X , y , alpha = 0.3 ); plt . plot ( XX , gam . predict ( XX ));

Getting Class Material Option 1A: Cloning the class repo and then copying the contents in a different directory so you can make changes. Open the Terminal in your computer and go to the Directory where you want to clone the repo. Then run git clone https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2020-CS109B.git If you have already cloned the repo, go inside the '/2020-CS109B/' directory and run git pull If you change the notebooks and then run git pull your changes will be overwritten. So create a playground folder and copy the folder with the notebook with which you want to work there. Option 1B: Forking the class repo To get access to the code used in class you will need to clone the class repo: https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2020-CS109B In order not to lose any changes you have made when updating the content (pulling) from the main repo, a good practice is to fork the repo locally. For more on this see Maddy Nakada's notes: How to Fork a Repo . NOTE: While Fork is a proper way to handle local changes, it doesn't magically solve everything -- if you edit a file that originated from our course repo (e.g., a HW notebook), and later pull from our 'upstream' repo again, any changes you make will require resolving merge conflict(s) . Thus, if you want to safetly and easily preserve any of your changes, we recommend renaming your files and/or copying them into an independent directory within your repo. You will need this year's repo: https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2020-CS109B.git 2. Running code: Option 2A: Managing Local Resources (supported by cs109b) Use Virtual Environments: I cannot stress this enough! Isolating your projects inside specific environments helps you manage dependencies and therefore keep your sanity. You can recover from mess-ups by simply deleting an environment. Sometimes certain installation of libraries conflict with one another. In order of isolation here is what you can do: a) set up a virtual environment, b) set up a virtual machine. The two most popular tools for setting up environments are: conda (a package and environment manager) pip (a Python package manager) with virtualenv (a tool for creating environments) We recommend using conda package installation and environments. conda installs packages from the Anaconda Repository and Anaconda Cloud, whereas pip installs packages from PyPI. Even if you are using conda as your primary package installer and are inside a conda environment, you can still use pip install for those rare packages that are not included in the conda ecosystem. See here for more details on how to manage Conda Environments . Exercise 1: Clone of Fork the CS109b git repository. Use the cs109b.yml file to create an environment: $ cd /2020-CS109B/content/labs/lab01/ $ conda env create -f cs109b.yml $ conda activate cs109b We have included the packages that you will need in the cs109b.yml file. It should be in the same directory as this notebook. Option 2B: Using Cloud Resources (optional) Using SEAS JupyterHub (supported by cs109b) Instructions for Using SEAS JupyterHub SEAS and FAS are providing you with a platform in AWS to use for the class, accessible via the 'JupyterHub' menu link in Canvas. Between now and March 1, each student will have their own t2.medium AWS ec2 instance with 4GB CPU RAM, and 2 vCPUs. After March 1st the instances will be upgraded to p2.xlarge AWS ec2 instances with a GPU, 61GB CPU RAM, 12GB GPU RAM, 10gB disk space, and 4 vCPUs. Most of the libraries such as keras, tensorflow, pandas, etc. are pre-installed. If a library is missing you may install it via the Terminal. NOTE : The AWS platform is funded by SEAS and FAS for the purposes of the class. It is not running against your individual credit. You are to use it with prudence; also it is not allowed to use it for purposes not related to this course. Help us keep this service: Make sure you stop your instance as soon as you do not need it. Using Google Colab (on your own) Google's Colab platform https://colab.research.google.com/ offers a GPU enviromnent to test your ideas, it's fast, free, with the only caveat that your files persist only for 12 hours. The solution is to keep your files in a repository and just clone it each time you use Colab. Using AWS in the Cloud (on your own) For those of you who want to have your own machines in the Cloud to run whatever you want, Amazon Web Services is a (paid) solution. For more see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/setting-up.html Remember, AWS is a paid service so if you let your machine run for days you will get charged! source: maybe Stanford's cs231n via Medium 3.

It can also be customized easily. Here is the basic seaborn tutorial: Seaborn tutorial . Plotting a function of 2 variables using contours In optimization, our objective function will often be a function of two or more variables. While it's hard to visualize a function of more than 3 variables, it's very informative to plot one of 2 variables. To do this we use contours. First we define the $x1$ and $x2$ variables and then construct their pairs using meshgrid . In [21]: import seaborn as sn In [11]: x1 = np . linspace ( - 0.1 , 0.1 , 50 ) x2 = np . linspace ( - 0.1 , 0.1 , 100 ) xx , yy = np . meshgrid ( x1 , x2 ) z = np . sqrt ( xx ** 2 + yy ** 2 ) plt . contour ( x1 , x2 , z ); We will be using tensorflow and keras TensorFlow is a framework for representing complicated ML algorithms and executing them in any platform, from a phone to a distributed system using GPUs. Developed by Google Brain, TensorFlow is used very broadly today. Keras , is a high-level API used for fast prototyping, advanced research, and production. We will use tf.keras which is TensorFlow's implementation of the keras API. Exercise 2: Run the following cells to make sure you have the basic libraries to do deep learning In [3]: from __future__ import absolute_import , division , print_function , unicode_literals # TensorFlow and tf.keras import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras import layers from tensorflow.keras import models from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.regularizers import l2 tf . keras . backend . clear_session () # For easy reset of notebook state. print ( tf . __version__ ) # You should see a >2.0.0 here! print ( tf . keras . __version__ ) 2.0.0 2.2.4-tf In [8]: # Checking if our machine has NVIDIA GPUs.
