<h3>Data Science for the Environment and Public Health</h3>
<p>We introduce the data setting and provide a high-level overview of the most important data science methods for estimating the health risks of air pollution and climate change related exposures.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://sites.sph.harvard.edu/francesca-dominici/people/francesca-dominici/">Francesca Dominici</a> is the Clarence James Gamble Professor of Biostatistics, Population and Data Science at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Director of the <a href="http://datascience.harvard.edu/">Data Science Initiative at Harvard University.</a></em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Dominici is an international leader at the interface of statistics, data science, causal inference and and public health. Dr. Dominici has stellar leadership in education and mentoring, and the promotion of diversity and gender equality.</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Dominici’s team has provided the scientific community and policy makers with robust evidence on the adverse health effects of air pollution, and climate change. Her studies have directly and routinely impacted air quality policy, leading to more stringent ambient air quality standards in the US.</em></p>

<h3>Data Science and Design</h3>
<p><em>Jose Luis García del Castillo y López is an architect, computational designer, and educator. He advocates for a future where programming and code are tools as natural to artists as paper and pencil. In his work, he explores creative opportunities at the intersection of design, technology, fabrication, data and art. He is currently a Lecturer in Architectural Technology at the Harvard Graduate School of Design.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Data Science for Case Law</h3>
<p>This project will challenge you and your programs to read and interpret case law, predicting classifications such as the winner and topic of a case. We will use the Caselaw Access Project, a recently-released dataset of all United States case law from the Harvard Law School Library.</p>
<p><em>Jack Cushman is a  Lecturer at the Harvard Law School. Jack teaches Computer Programming for Lawyers at Harvard Law School and is a senior developer at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab. He previously practiced as an appellate lawyer at the firm of Stern, Shapiro, Weissberg and Garin.</em></p>
<p><em>Kelly Fitzpatrick is a Research Associate at the Harvard Law School Library. Kelly runs outreach and communications for the Caselaw Access Project at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab. She holds a masters in library science and worked previously on the Harvard Open Access Project.</em></p>
</li>

<h3>Predicting Disease Activity</h3>
<p>This project involves applying machine learning techniques and novel Internet-based data sources for real-time monitoring and short-term forecasting of population-level disease activity.</p>
<p>Through this module, you will learn how to design and deploy predictive models to track and forecast epidemic outbreaks in real time. For this, you will gain access to epidemiological data of ongoing and historical disease outbreaks in the US and other countries. Diseases of interest include Influenza (USA), Dengue fever (Puerto Rico and Peru), Ebola (DRC), Coronoavirus 2019-nCoV (China and the world).</p>
<p>Given that most epidemiological monitoring systems in the world provide lagged information about disease activity (case counts of infected people are known to decision-makers weeks after the fact due to lab testing and data collection delays), you will learn how to design and implement time-series based prediction models to estimate the likely disease activity in current time and future weeks.</p>
<p>You will learn how to utilize data sources that were not originally designed to be indicators of disease activity to complement time-series predictive models. These data sources include: disease-related Google search activity, disease-related Twitter microblogs, air travel, and weather patterns. </p>
<p><em>Dr. Mauricio Santillana is a physicist and applied mathematician with expertise in mathematical modeling and scientific computing. He has worked in multiple research areas frequently analyzing big data sets to understand and predict the behavior of complex systems. His research modeling population growth patterns has informed policy makers in Mexico and Texas. His research in numerical analysis and computational fluid dynamics has been used to improve models of coastal floods due to hurricanes, and to improve the performance of global atmospheric chemistry models.</em></p>
<p><em>Mauricio received a B.S. in physics with highest honors from the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico in Mexico City, and a master’s and PhD in computational and applied mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin. Mauricio first joined Harvard as a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Center for the Environment and has been a lecturer in applied mathematics at the Harvard SEAS, receiving two awards for excellence in teaching.</em></p>

<h3>How Data Science is Changing Business Operations</h3>
<p>Data Science has become a core function in many firms today, driving innovation and new data-intensive business and operating models. This project will demonstrate how data and data science offers unprecedented opportunities to organizations in running their business such as influencing HR practices, project planning capabilities, machine failure and maintenance, etc. This project will expose students to concepts related to business operations and offer an in depth understanding of the role of data and predictions in these operations.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Yael Grushka-Cockayne is Visiting Associate Professor of Business Administration, Harvard Business School. Associate Professor Grushka-Cockayne's research and teaching activities focus on data science, analytics, forecasting, decision analysis, project management, and behavioral decision-making. Yael is an award-winning teacher and in 2014 was named one of "21 Thought-Leader Professors" in Data Science. At HBS Yael teaches the required Technology and Operations Management course and an elective course on Business Analytics. She has been teaching in the Harvard Business Analytics Program, powered by 2U, since 2018. Previously, Yael taught courses on Decision Analysis, Project Management, and Data Science in Business. Yael's "Fundamentals of Project Planning and Management" Coursera MOOC had over 200,000 enrolled, across 200 countries worldwide.</em></p>
<p><em>Before starting her academic career, she worked in San Francisco as a marketing director of an ERP company. As an expert in the areas of project management, she has served as a consultant to international firms in the aerospace and pharma industries. Yael is an Associate Editor at Management Science, Operation Research, and Decision Analysis. Education: B.Sc., Ben-Gurion University; MSc, London School of Economics; Ph.D., MRes, London Business School</em></p>

<h3>Normalizing Flows</h3>
<p>A normalizing flow can provide a mapping of probability density in one space to another. These functions are invertible and have an accessible Jacobian (i.e. you can figure out how the volume of a region of parameter space is distorted by the mapping). A neural net with these properties can be a convenient way to represent a probability distribution function in high dimensions by mapping it to (or from) a unit Gaussian. We will apply this concept to some distributions of interest in astronomy, and show the power of this approach.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Douglas Finkbeiner has a joint appointment in the Department of Astronomy and Department of Physics, working on topics ranging from dark matter to interstellar dust. He is currently excited about the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), a 5000-fiber spectrograph on the 4m telescope at Kitt Peak, AZ.</em></p>
